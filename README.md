## Description

Crawl McGill's website and the Visual Schedule Builder to determine which courses are being offered and information (professor, timing, capacity) for each section/

## Installation

    $ sudo gem install mcgill-utils

## Usage

So far, the gem only encapsulates the Visual Schedule Builder API in order to provide a list of sections available for each course, along with the professor and timing, etc, of each section.

You need to provide the semester and a list of courses you're interested in. The semester is formated YYYYMM, where the month is either 05 for Summer, 09 for Fall, or 01 for Winter. Courses are formatted `CODE-###`, e.g., `MGCR-293`. Multiple courses can be given at once, either as multiple parameters or as an array.

    > courses = McGill::VSB.new 201409, 'MGCR-293', 'FINE-441', 'COMP-202'

or

    > courses = McGill::VSB.new 201409, ['MGCR-293', 'FINE-449', 'COMP-202']

To get information about each courses section, call `#sections`

    > courses.sections
    => {"FINE-449"=>
       [{:crn=>"8270",
         :kind=>"Lec",
         :waitlist=>false,
         :teacher=>"di Pietro, Vadim",
         :times=>["Thursday 6:05 PM - 8:55 PM, Sep 2 to Dec 3"],
         :notes=>"Enrolment limited by program \nJoint BCom/MBA course."}],
         #...
    }

To check whether it's possible to register for any of the sections, call `#availability`. You'll get back a hash with the crn of the section as the key. If the section has a waitlist, then a result of `true` means that there is space for you to join the waitlist. If there's no waitlist, then `true` means you can join the section immediately. A result of `false` always means that the section, and waitlist if applicable, are full.

    > courses.availability
    => {"BUSA-465"=>{10097=>true}, "COMP-202"=>{823=>true, 824=>false, 825=>false}}
